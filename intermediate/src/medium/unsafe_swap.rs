/*
  Problem 45: Unsafe — Swap with Raw Pointers

  Write a function that takes two mutable references to i32 values and swaps them
  using raw pointers inside an unsafe block. Do not use std::mem::swap.

  Run the tests for this problem with:
    cargo test --test unsafe_swap_test
*/

pub fn unsafe_swap(a: &mut i32, b: &mut i32) {
  let a_pointer = a as *mut i32;
  let b_pointer = b as *mut i32;

  unsafe {
    let temp;

    temp = *a_pointer;
    *a_pointer = *b_pointer;
    *b_pointer = temp;
  }
}
